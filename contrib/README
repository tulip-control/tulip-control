This ``contrib`` directory is a place for things that are not a part of TuLiP
per se but are still closely dependent and generally useful.  Their versions (if
given) are entirely independent of TuLiP.  Below is a summary of contents.

AES
  specification generation for an electric power system.  Consult AES/README.

fmu
  routines to export a TuLiP controller as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU).

logging
  JSON file containing a default logging configuration and an example using it.

macports
  packaging via MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/>

matlabsim
  files required to export controllers to Simulink blocks and a couple examples
  for reference.  Consult matlab/README.

mptmodels
  functions for exporting [MPT](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~mpt/3/) dynamic models
  to matlab ``mat`` files and then importing those to ``tulip`` data structures.

nessainstall
  instructions for installing TuLiP on a big computer at Caltech but likely
  useful for similar settings, in particular in which there are old versions of
  system software, where only SSH access is available, and on a non-superuser
  account.  Consult nessainstall/README.md.

parity games
  experimental implementation of algorithms for solving parity games.

readdstar.py, spin2dstar.py
  interfacing with LTL2DSTAR <http://ltl2dstar.de/>.  These may later be
  incorporated into TuLiP, in particular the tulip.spec subpackage.

xml
  functions for dumping/loading tulip data structures to/from XML.
