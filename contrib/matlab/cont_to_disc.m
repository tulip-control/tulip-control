% Takes a continuous state and a list of Polyhedra and then returns the
% index of the region that the continuous state is in. This gets us the
% variable "loc" when working with a continuous system. 

% Function throws an error if a point is outside the specified domain.

function discrete_state = cont_to_disc(state)

% Get regions struct from base workspace

% Initialize value of discrete variable
