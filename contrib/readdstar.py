Load output of LTL2DSTAR into a NetworkX DiGraph

The official website of LTL2DSTAR is <http://ltl2dstar.de/>, where a
definition of its output format can be found.  Use "-" in place of
FILE to read from stdin.

* Parsing is done by hand; consider changing to use pyparsing.  N.B.,
  the current implementation is lax about the input file, i.e., it
  accepts valid LTL2DSTAR output along with variants.

* The Automaton class is a very light derivative of networkx.DiGraph;
  in other words, if you prefer to only work with a DiGraph, it is
  easy to modify the existing code to do so.  Expect the name to
  change later, especially if (when) it becomes integrated into TuLiP.

* readdstar.py is a commandline utility.  It expects to be given the
  name of file from which to read (previously recorded) output of
  LTL2DSTAR.  Alternatively, use "-" to read from stdin.  E.g., if
  ltl2dstar and ltl2ba are in the current directory, try

    $ echo 'U a b' | ltl2dstar --ltl2nba=spin:ltl2ba - -|./readdstar.py -

* Each edge (transition) is labeled with two things:
  - "formula" : a disjunctive normal form expression for when the edge
                should be taken; and
  - "subsets of AP": a list of sets of atomic propositions.

  E.g., if AP = {p, q}, and (1,3) is an edge in the Automaton object A,
  then

    A.edge[1][3]["subsets of AP"] = [set(), set(['p'])]

  means that the transition (1,3) should be taken (assuming current
  execution has led to state 1) if the none of the atomic propositions
  are true (i.e., !p & !q holds), or precisely "p" is true (i.e., p &
  !q holds).
