# Environment variables and specification
#
# The environment can issue a park signal that the robot just respond
# to by moving to the lower left corner of the grid.  We assume that
# the park signal is turned off infinitely often.

# 
# System specification
#
# The system specification is that the robot should repeatedly revisit
# the upper right corner of the grid while at the same time responding
# to the park signal by visiting the lower left corner.  The LTL
# specification is given by 
#
#     []<> home && [](park -> <>lot)
#
# Since this specification is not in GR(1) form, we introduce the
# variable X0reach that is initialized to True and the specification
# [](park -> <>lot) becomes
#
#     [](X (X0reach) <-> lot || (X0reach && !park))
#

# Augment the environmental description to make it GR(1)
#! TODO: create a function to convert this type of spec automatically

# Define the specification
#! NOTE: maybe "synthesize" should infer the atomic proposition from the 
# transition system? Or, we can declare the mode variable, and the values
# of the mode variable are read from the transition system.
