This example illustrates the use of TuLiP to synthesize a reactive
controller for system whose dynamics are described by a discrete
transition system.

# System dynamics
#
# The system is modeled as a discrete transition system in which the
# robot can be located anyplace no a 2x3 grid of cells.  Transitions
# between adjacent cells are allowed, which we model as a transition
# system in this example (it would also be possible to do this via a
# formula)
#
# We label the states using the following picture
#
#     +----+----+----+
#     | X3 | X4 | X5 |
#     +----+----+----+
#     | X0 | X1 | X2 |
#     +----+----+----+

# Environment variables and specification
#
# The environment can issue a park signal that the robot just respond
# to by moving to the lower left corner of the grid.  We assume that
# the park signal is turned off infinitely often.
#
# @environ_section@

# @environ_section_end@

# 
# System specification
#
# The system specification is that the robot should repeatedly revisit
# the upper right corner of the grid while at the same time responding
# to the park signal by visiting the lower left corner.  The LTL
# specification is given by 
#
#     []<> home && [](park -> <>lot)
#
# Since this specification is not in GR(1) form, we introduce the
# variable X0reach that is initialized to True and the specification
# [](park -> <>lot) becomes
#
#     [](next(X0reach) <-> lot || (X0reach && !park))
#

# @specs_setup_section@
# Augment the system description to make it GR(1)
#! TODO: create a function to convert this type of spec automatically

sys_safe = {'(X (X0reach) <-> lot) || (X0reach && !park)'}
sys_prog |= {'X0reach'}

# At this point we can synthesize the controller using one of the available
# methods.  Here we make use of JTLV.
