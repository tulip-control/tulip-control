    is the interleaving where at each step,
    only one system/process/player makes a move/executes.
    
    So it is a type of parallel system.
    
    This is an important distinction with the C{strong_product},
    because that includes "diagonal" transitions, i.e., two
    processes executing truly concurrently.
    
    Note that a Cartesian interleaving is different from a
    strong interleaving, because the latter can skip states
    and transition directly along the diagonal.
    
    For a model of computation, strong interleaving
    would accurately model the existence of multiple cores,
    not just multiple processes executing on a single core.
