Installation
------------

TuLiP works with Python 3. The Python versions supported are defined as
the argument of parameter `python_requires`, within `setup.py`.
To install with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_
from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tulip>`_::

  $ pip install tulip

or from source::

  $ pip install .

``pip`` installs Python dependencies `automatically
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#installation-order>`_.
They are listed in ``install_requires`` within ``setup.py``.
The only Python packages that you may want to install yourself,
in order to link them properly are:

* `NumPy <http://numpy.org/>`_
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_

The following are optional dependencies,
listed with a summary of dependent features:

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ --
  many visualization features

* `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ --
  to plot graphs, for example discrete state machines

* `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_ --
  construction and manipulation of discrete abstractions

* `GLPK <http://www.gnu.org/s/glpk/>`_ --
  fast linear programming solver

   :align: center

For computing discrete abstractions from hybrid system descriptions,
it is highly recommended that you install both CVXOPT and GLPK.
Note that you need to install GLPK *before* installing CVXOPT,
and follow the `CVXOPT installation instructions
<http://cvxopt.org/install/index.html>`_
to link CVXOPT to GLPK.
(If you use
`MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/>`_,
please note that MacPorts does not do this linking automatically.)

The latest release of TuLiP can be downloaded also from
`SourceForge
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/tulip-control/files/>`_.


.. _synt-tools-sec-label:

Alternative discrete synthesis tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default synthesis tool for GR(1) and Rabin(1) specifications is
`omega <https://github.com/tulip-control/omega>`_
(installed by ``pip``).

TuLiP can use other tools for formal synthesis.
Those for which an interface is available are listed below.
Also consult :doc:`specifications` concerning relevant syntax and
summaries of the specification languages.
Generally, direct interfaces are defined as modules in
the subpackage ``tulip.interfaces``.
However, these tools can be accessed indirectly,
by appropriately setting parameters for various functions in TuLiP,
such as ``tulip.synth.synthesize()``.

These are *optional dependencies*. TuLiP is useful without having them
installed, but certain functionality is only available when they are.


GR(1)
`````

* `gr1c <http://scottman.net/2012/gr1c>`_.
  Please install at least version 0.9.0.
  The introduction of
  `the manual of gr1c <https://tulip-control.github.io/gr1c/>`_
  is a good place to begin.

* `gr1py <https://github.com/slivingston/gr1py>`_

* `slugs <https://github.com/LTLMoP/slugs>`_


LTL
```

* `Lily <http://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/research/design_verification/lily/>`_,
  which is based on `Wring <http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~rbloem/wring.html>`_.


Testing your installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TuLiP is distributed with tests for itself that, like those for NumPy, provide a
way to check that TuLiP is behaving as expected.  To perform basic tests that
should pass on any TuLiP installation, from the command-line try ::

  $ ./run_tests.py

There is an extensive test suite that includes tests involving optional
dependencies. To perform it, ``./run_tests.py full``. It is important to note
that some tests may fail because an **optional** dependency is missing, not
because the TuLiP installation itself is flawed. Use the flag "-h" to get a
description of driver script options.  More details about testing TuLiP oriented
for developers are provided in the :doc:`dev_guide`.


.. _newbie-scipy-sec-label:

New to Python?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newcomers to scientific computing with Python should read
:ref:`newbie-scipy-sec-label`.

If you don't already use Python for scientific computing, consider using
`Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) <http://enthought.com>`_ or `Enthought
Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_. This may make the
installation process easier.  The EPD Free and Canopy Express distributions come
with Python and includes NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib. EPD Free or Canopy Express
together with networkx, cvxopt, and PLY is sufficient to run TuLiP.

Alternatives to Enthought are listed on the `SciPy installation webpage
<http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_.  In particular, also try `Anaconda
<http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/>`_.

EPD seems to work fine on most platforms but if you cannot get it to work, more
alternative packages for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows are mentioned below.


.. _troubleshoot-sec-label:

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regarding installation of numerical computing packages (NumPy, etc.),
for the love of all that is good, please run tests to verify proper
behavior!  ...unless you use a very well established install method.
Nonetheless, unit testing is always good practice.

If you think the necessary packages are installed, but are unsure how
to debug Python, then consider the following tips.  To see the python
path, execute::

  $ python -c 'import sys; print("\n".join(sys.path))'

Each path searched is listed on a new line. You can augment this list
by appending locations (separated by ":") to the environment variable
**PYTHONPATH**.  To see what it's currently set to, and add a new path
to "/home/frodo/work", use::

  $ echo $PYTHONPATH
  $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/frodo/work

You may need to tweak the export statement depending on your terminal
shell.  All of my examples are tested with zsh (the Z shell).

Mac OS X
````````

For installing SciPy, NumPy, consider trying
`Scipy Superpack for Mac OSX
<http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/>`_ by Chris Fonnesbeck.

When installing CVXOPT using MacPorts, there are some compatibility issues
that cause CVXOPT to fail to install.  The following customizations will link
numpy against Apple's implementation of LAPACK and BLAS and bypass this
issue:

* Uninstall atlas (if installed)::

  $ sudo port uninstall atlas; sudo port clean atlas

* Uninstall numpy (if installed)::

  $ sudo port uninstall numpy; sudo port clean numpy

* Install numpy without atlas::

  $ sudo port install py27-numpy -atlas

* Install cvxopt without atlas or dsdp::

  $ sudo port install py27-cvxopt -atlas -dsdp

Note that if you have packages that rely on numpy (such as scipy), you will
have to uninstall and reinstall those packages as well.

Microsoft Windows
`````````````````

For Windows users, type the above commands without "$" in the terminal. For
example, check the version of your Python by typing::

  python -V

To check whether the packages has been installed, open a new terminal and try::

  python
  import numpy
  import scipy
  import cvxopt

If an error message occurs, the package might not be visible on the current path
or may not be installed at all. When you cannot find a suitable package of
NumPy, SciPy, CVXOPT, and Matplotlib for your system, consider trying
`Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_ by Christoph Gohlke.

The package of gr1c for Windows still cannot be found. But without this package,
you can also run most TuLiP functions.


Installing other Python dependencies
````````````````````````````````````

The command ``pip install ...`` will usually suffice. To
get `PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/>`_, try::

  $ pip install ply


.. _venv-pydoc-sec-label:

virtualenv and pydoc
````````````````````

If you have installed TuLiP into a `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_-built environment, then the documentation may not
be visible through `pydoc <http://docs.python.org/library/pydoc.html>`_ .  We
describe two solutions here, the first being more general. ::

  $ alias pydoc='python -m pydoc'

If that fails, try to explicitly augment the path used by pydoc with an alias.
E.g., suppose your username is "frodo", you are running Python v2.6, and your
virtual environment is called "PY_scratch" under your home directory.  Then the
appropriate alias is similar to::

  $ alias pydoc='PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/frodo/PY_scratch/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ pydoc'

To set this alias for every new terminal session, add the line to your shell
startup script; e.g., ``~/.bashrc`` for bash, or ``~/.zshrc`` for zsh [#f1]_.
To test it, try looking at the transys subpackage by entering::

  $ pydoc tulip.transys

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] On Unix systems, in particular GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, the
         terminal shell treats ``~`` as a special symbol representing
         the home directory of the current user.
