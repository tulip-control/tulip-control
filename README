TuLiP
=====

Installation
------------

In most cases, it suffices to

  python setup.py install

To avoid checking for dependencies and optional packages, add the
option "nocheck"::

  python setup.py install nocheck

Detailed instructions, including notes about dependencies and
troubleshooting, are available at

http://tulip-control.sourceforge.net/doc/install.html

The documentation sources (see below) can be found under doc/


Sphinx generated documentation
------------------------------

The sources under doc/ are built using Sphinx, so the usual steps apply, i.e.

  make html

Note that a Windows build file, make.bat, was auto-generated at the
time of first initialising the docs configuration files (ca. 2011 May
8) but is not actively maintained.  It is included for convenience;
please consider Makefile to be the ground truth.

A built copy for the most recent release of TuLiP is available online at

http://tulip-control.sourceforge.net/doc/


Format specifications
---------------------

The directory doc/formats/ contains definitions and documentation
about data and file formats used in the project.  The goal is to
formalize specifications expected in the code in a medium external to
it.  Some of this is done in docstrings, but formats/ should provide
single and normative points of reference.


Testing
-------

Tests are performed using nose; see http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/
for details.  From the root of the source tree (i.e., where setup.py
is located), run::

  nosetests

To change default options, edit the "nosetests" section in setup.cfg.
To disable output capture, add the flag "-s" when invoking nose.
