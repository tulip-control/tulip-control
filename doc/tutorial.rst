Tutorial and Examples
=====================

TuLiP is developed for synthesis of discrete controllers for hybrid control
systems, including supervisory controllers, switching controllers and
receding horizon temporal logic planners (not supported in this version).

To design a system, humans start by expressing the intended design in
mathematics. This mathematical description is then given to a computer,
which computes a controller to be used for creating the physical system.

.. image:: tulip_workflow.png
   :alt: Overview of what TuLiP does.

Whether a controller exists, and whether the computer succeeds in finding
a controller, depend on the feasibility of the specification, as well as the
computational resources available and the algorithms used.

The main elements that the mathematical specification describes are:

* Goal
* Physics
* Environment

The goal is what we want the system to accomplish.
The physics is how the system behaves in the real world, e.g., inertia.
The environment is the rest of the world, and what assumptions are made
about how it interacts with the system that is being designed.


Synthesis of Reactive Controllers
---------------------------------
To illustrate the basic synthesis capabilities of TuLiP, we synthesize a
simple discrete state controller for a robotic motion control system.


Problem Formulation
```````````````````
We consider a physical system with given dynamics ("plant") and
a controller that we are about to design ourselves.
Both discrete-valued and continuous-valued variables may be used
to describe the behavior of the system.

The environment can affect this system in two ways:

1. through discrete-valued variables
2. through continuous-valued variables, understood as "disturbance" (noise).

In summary, we study problems with the following elements:

1. discrete-valued plant variables ("discrete state")
2. continuous-valued plant variables ("continuous state")
3. discrete-valued environment variables
4. continuous-valued environment variables (disturbance)
5. specification: formulae, including difference equations.

Here, `discrete` state refers to variables that take only a finite number
of possible values in the system behaviors that interest us,
whereas `continuous` state refers to variables that can take
an infinite number of possible values, e.g., the position of the car.

The `environment` state is related to factors over which the controller
has no authority, such as the position of an obstacle, or the outside
temperature.  At any given time, the controller regulates the `system` (or
`controlled`) state so as to satisfy the specification, given the
current state of plant, environment, and the controller's "internal" state
(memory -- think of a microprocessor's own memory).

We say that a specification is `realizable` if there exists a controller
exists that steers the plant in a way that, for all environment behaviors
that we assume are possible to happen, the specification requirements
on the plant are satisfied.

We will use the following variables and functions of time to
describe the continuous dynamics:

1. :math:`t` a variable that represents discrete time
2. :math:`s[t]` continuous state,
3. :math:`u[t]` control input signal,
4. :math:`d[t]` (uncontrolled) disturbance.

Suppose the continuous state of the system evolves according to the
following discrete-time linear time-invariant state space model:
for :math:`t \in \{0, 1, 2, ...\}`

.. math::
   s[t+1]  =   As[t] + Bu[t] + Ed[t] + K
   :label: dynamics

where:

1. :math:`u[t] \in U`
2. :math:`d[t] \in D`
3. :math:`s[0] \in S`
4. :math:`S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n` are the continuous states
    over which we study the system behavior,
5. :math:`U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m` is the set of admissible control inputs,
6. :math:`D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p` is the set of exogenous disturbances
    that we assume are possible.

We consider the case where the sets :math:`S, U, D` are bounded polytopes.


The control design problem is solved in two phases.
In the fist phase we abstract continuous-valued variables,
replacing them with discrete-valued variables,
with suitable constraints on their assumed and required behavior that
faithfully represent what is going on at the continuous level.

At the discrete level, a controller is synthesized from a specification
expressed in temporal logic. The specification is written in what
is known as an assume-guarantee form:

.. math::
   \varphi = \big(\varphi_{init} \wedge \varphi_e)
   \overset{sr}{\rightarrow}
   \varphi_s
   :label: spec

where:

1. :math:`\varphi_{init}` is an `assumption` on what initial states are possible
2. :math:`\varphi_e` is an `assumption` about how the environment behaves,
3. :math:`\varphi_s` is a `requirement` on the desired behavior we want,
   and the physical constraints that have to be satisfied.

These descriptions are not absolute. Some times, there are aspects of
a problem that can be modeled in equivalent ways as either assumptions or
requirements, using environment or system variables to represent them.
This is a choice made during modeling of a problem with mathematics.

As described in the :doc:`intro`, our approach to this reactive control
system synthesis consists of the following main steps:

   1. Abstract the continuous-valued variables using discrete-valued
      variables, by :ref:`generating a partition of the continuous states that
      preserves the meaning of statements that appear in the specification.
      <ssec:prop-part>`

   2. Abstract the possible changes of continuous-valued variables,
      by :ref:`discretizing the continuous dynamics,
      based on solving reachability problems. <ssec:disc>`

   3. :ref:`Digital design synthesis,<ssec:syn>`
      by solving games of infinite duration.

These steps are summarized in the following figure:

.. image:: tulip_summary.png
   :alt: Overview of TuLiP input, computation, and output.

In particular, realizability of the specification (together with the
abstracted continuous dynamics) is decided in the middle of this image,
by using reactive synthesis algorithms.


.. _ssec:prop-part:

Proposition Preserving Partition of Continuous State Space
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Given the continuous state space :math:`S` of the system and the set
:math:`\Pi_c` of propositions on the continuous state of the system, we
partition :math:`S` into a finite number of cells such that all the
continuous states in each cell satisfy exactly the same set of propositions
in :math:`\Pi_c`.

This can be done using the following function call:

     .. autofunction:: abstract.prop2part
	:noindex:

The above function returns a proposition preserving partition as a PropPreservingPartition object.

     .. autoclass:: abstract.PropPreservingPartition
	:noindex:

.. _ssec:disc:

Continuous State Space Discretization
`````````````````````````````````````
Given a proposition preserving partition of the continuous state space and
the evolution of the continuous state as in :eq:`dynamics`,
we refine the partition based on the reachability relation between cells
and obtain a finite state abstraction of the evolution of the continuous state,
represented by a finite transition system.

The abstraction algorithms that are implemented in TuLiP take the:

* description of the dynamics as difference equations that
  are piecewise-affine over a polytopic partition, together with the

* proposition-preserving partition of the continuous state space,

and refine them into a (discrete) graph and a new partition of the state space
into polytopes. These polytopes can be smaller in size than the polytopes
that comprise the proposition-preserving partition.

The nodes of this graph (which is generated from the abstraction algorithm)
correspond to the polytopes of this new partition of the state space.
The arcs (directed edges) that connect the nodes represent feasible transitions
in the continuous state space.

When creating these arcs, the abstraction algorithm ensures that it will be
possible to guide the system from the source region (polytope) of the arc,
to the destination region of the arc, in the presence of any environment
disturbances specified in the difference equations.

Ensuring this property during abstraction is necessary to enable the
implementation of the discrete controller, that is synthesized automatically
in a later step described below, by continuous feedback controllers.

The next figure shows this abstraction step. We start from the proposition
preserving partition on the left, together with the dynamics, and
obtain by abstraction the discrete graph and matching partition on the right.

.. image:: abstracting_dynamics.png
   :alt: Abstracting the dynamics by refining the polytopic partition of
         the state space, and creating a graph that corresponds to this
         partition, and to the transitions that are implementable between
         regions of this partition.

The LtiSysDyn class is used to define continuous dynamics.

     .. autoclass:: hybrid.LtiSysDyn
	:noindex:

Once we have the proposition preserving partition and the continuous dynamics,
continuous state space discretization can be done using the following function call:

     .. autofunction:: abstract.discretize
	:noindex:

.. _ssec:syn:


The option ``use_all_horizon`` changes both how reachability is computed
during discretization, and also what assumption is made about when the
discrete-valued environment variables are sampled:

- With ``use_all_horizon = False``, a fixed sampling period is assumed,
  and reachability problems are solved for a fixed (discrete-time) horizon
  equal to `N` steps.

- With ``use_all_horizon = True``, reachability considers trajectories
  that take `1..N` steps. As a result, from different states, the same
  discrete-strategy (see below) transition can take a different number
  of time steps to be implemented in the continuous state space.
  This requires the assumption that the system can sample the discrete-valued
  environment variables at times that continuous transitions complete.


Digital design synthesis
````````````````````````
The continuous state space discretization generates a finite state
abstraction of the continuous state, represented by a finite transition
system.  Each state in this finite transition system corresponds to a cell
in the continuous domain.  A transition :math:`c_i \to c_j` in this finite
state system indicates that from any continuous state :math:`s_0` that
belongs to cell :math:`c_i`, there exists a sequence of control inputs
:math:`u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{N-1}` that takes the system to another
continuous state :math:`s_{N}` in cell :math:`c_j`.  Hence, under the
assumption that the desired behavior is a stutter-invariant property,
we can describe the continuous dynamics by an LTL formula of the form

.. math::
   (v = c_i) \implies \big(\bigvee_{j \text{ s.t. } c_i \to c_j} v' = c_j\big),

where :math:`v` is a new discrete variable that describes in which cell
the continuous state is.

Since the partition is proposition preserving, all the continuous states
that belong to the same cell satisfy exactly the same set of propositions on
the continuous state. By the abuse of notation, we write :math:`c_j \models
X_i` if all the continuous states in cell :math:`c_j` satisfy proposition
:math:`X_i`.  Then, we can replace any proposition :math:`X_i` on the
continuous state variables by the formula :math:`\displaystyle{\bigvee_{j
\text{ s.t. } c_j \models X_i} v = c_j}`.

Putting everything together, we now obtain a specification of the form in
:eq:`spec` (see also :doc:`specifications`).  We can then use a GR(1) game
solver, as those available in `omega <https://github.com/tulip-control/omega>`_
and `gr1c <http://scottman.net/2012/gr1c>`_
to automatically synthesize a strategy that
ensures the satisfaction of the specification, taking into account all the
possible behaviors of the environment.  This is done using the
:literal:`synth.synthesize` function:

    .. autofunction:: synth.synthesize
	:noindex:

This synthesis step is conceptually depicted in the next figure,
where the synthesis algorithms are used to decide whether a strategy exists
that guarantees the specification requirements, under the specification
assumptions. If such a strategy exists, then it is constructed.

.. image:: strategy_synthesis.png
   :alt: Reactive synthesis can be regarded as solving a discrete game.

More details about how Moore/Mealy capability,
the assume-guarantee form of specification, and
quantification of initial variable values are selected is described
in the class :literal:`spec.GRSpec`:

    .. autofunction:: spec.GRSpec

The resulting output is a controller function that decides what values
the controlled (discrete-valued) variables should take next.

A `Moore` controller function cannot read the next
values of (discrete-valued) environment variables before taking this
decision, whereas a `Mealy` controller function can.
Moore controllers are more realistic, and less prone to modeling errors,
thus recommended.

    .. autofunction:: transys.machines.Transducer
	:noindex:

It should be noted that a temporal logic formula / property should be
notionally distinguished from a synthesis problem:

- You may write a formula to describe how a variable can change over time.
  You may write even an assume-guarantee formula to describe an open-system
  specification (i.e., how a system should behave in a certain environment).

- A synthesis problem includes a definition of what the controller can do,
  and whether the synthesizer should satisfy all initial conditions we wrote,
  or is allowed to pick some initial conditions (thus synthesize the initial
  conditions too).

You may encounter this distinction if you give to ``synthesize`` both
a transition system and temporal logic formulae.
You may choose to define strategy capabilities (Moore/Mealy) as
attributes to both, but these choices will have to agree,
because one controller will be synthesized, not two.

Example 1: Discrete State Robot Motion Planning
```````````````````````````````````````````````
This example is provided in examples/discrete.py.
It illustrates the use of the ``omega`` module in synthesizing a planner
for a robot that only needs to make discrete decision.

.. image:: robot_simple.*
   :align: center

We consider the robot moving around the regions as shown in the above figure
while receiving externally triggered park signal.
The specification of the robot is

.. math::
   \varphi = \square \diamond(\neg park)
   \overset{sr}{\rightarrow}
   (\square \diamond(s \in C_5)
   \wedge \square(park \implies \diamond(s \in C_0))).

We cannot, however, deal with this specification directly since it is not in
the form of GR(1).  An equivalent GR(1) specification of the above
specification can be obtained by introducing an auxiliary discrete system
variable :math:`X0reach,` initialized to `True`. The transition relation of
:math:`X0reach,` is given by
:math:`\square(X0reach' = (s \in C_0 \vee (X0reach \wedge \neg park))).`

To automatically synthesize a planner for this robot, we first import the
necessary modules:

.. highlight:: python

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @import_section@
   :end-before: @import_section_end@

We next define the dynamics of the system, modeled as a discrete transition
system in which the robot can be located anyplace no a 2x3 grid of cells.
Transitions between adjacent cells are allowed, which we model as a
transition system in this example (it would also be possible to do this via
a formula):

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @system_dynamics_section@
   :end-before: @system_dynamics_section_end@

To create the specification, we label some of the states with names:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @system_labels_section@
   :end-before: @system_labels_section_end@

These names serve as atomic propositions that are true when the system is in
the indicated states.

The environment can issue a park signal that requires the robot to respond
by moving to the lower left corner of the grid.  We assume that
the park signal is turned off infinitely often.  We describe this using the
following code:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @environ_section@
   :end-before: @environ_section_end@

Here the specification is broken up into four pieces: a description of the
discrete environment variables (:literal:`env_vars`), a specification for
the initial condition for the environment (:literal:`env_init`), a progress
formula (:literal:`env_prog`) that must be satisfied infinitely often, and
a safety formula (:literal:`env_safe`) that must hold at all times during
the execution.  The :literal:`set()` command is used to initialize one or
more of these variables to the empty set.

The system specification is that the robot should repeatedly revisit
the upper right corner of the grid while at the same time responding
to the park signal by visiting the lower left corner.  The LTL
specification is given by

.. math::
   \square\diamond home \wedge \square (park \implies \diamond lot)

Since this specification is not in GR(1) form, we introduce the
variable X0reach that is initialized to True and the specification
:math:`\square(park \implies \diamond lot)` becomes

.. math::
     \square( (X0reach' = lot) \vee (X0reach \wedge \neg park))

The python code to implement this logic is given by:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @specs_setup_section@
   :end-before: @specs_setup_section_end@

Note the use of :literal:`<->` for equivalence (equality).  As in the case
of the environmental specification, the system specification consists of
four parts that provide additional discrete system variables
(:literal:`sys_vars`), initial conditions (:literal:`sys_init`), progress
conditions (:literal:`sys_prog`) and safety conditions
(:literal:`sys_safe`).

Finally, we construct the full specification for the system and environment
by creating a GR(1) specification consisting of the various pieces we have
constructed:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @specs_create_section@
   :end-before: @specs_create_section_end@

To synthesize the controller, we call the :literal:`synth.synthesize()`
function.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @synthesize@
   :end-before: @synthesize_end@

The controller can now be saved in graphical form, or printed if
the dependencies for DOT layout are not available:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/discrete.py
   :start-after: @plot_print@
   :end-before: @plot_print_end@

.. _ssec:ex2:

Example 2: Continuous State Robot Motion Planning
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
This example is provided in examples/continuous.py.
It is an extension of the previous example by including continuous dynamics.

First, we import the necessary modules,
specify the smv file, spc file and aut file,
and specify the environment and the discrete system variables
as in the previous example.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/continuous.py
   :start-after: @import_section@
   :end-before: @import_section_end@

Next, we specify the continuous dynamics.  This includes specifying the
continuous state space, propositions on continuous variables, and the
dynamics.  The robot dynamics in this case is :math:`\dot{x} = u_x + 5d_x,
\dot{y} = u_y + 5d_y,` discretized with a sampling time of 0.2.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/continuous.py
   :start-after: @dynamics_section@
   :end-before: @dynamics_section_end@

Now, we can construct the proposition preserving partition of the continuous
state space and discretize the continuous state space based on the dynamics.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/continuous.py
   :start-after: @partition_section@
   :end-before: @partition_section_end@

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/continuous.py
   :start-after: @discretize_section@
   :end-before: @discretize_section_end@

The rest is the same as in the previous example.  We specify the
environment, create a GR(1) system specification, and synthesize a
controller.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/continuous.py
   :start-after: @synthesize_section@
   :end-before: @synthesize_section_end@


Working with Systems with Piecewise Affine Dynamics
---------------------------------------------------
TuLiP can also handle piecewise affine dynamics of the form:

for :math:`t \in \{0,1,2,...\}`

.. math::
   s[t+1]  &=   A_is[t] + B_iu[t] + E_id[t] + K_i\\
   u[t]    &\in U_i\\
   d[t]    &\in D_i\\
   s[t]	   &\in S_i
   :label: pwadynamics

where :math:`S_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n` for :math:`i \in \{0,1,2,
\ldots,n_s\}` form a polytopic partition of the state space :math:`S`, in
:eq:`dynamics`, :math:`U_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m` is the set of admissible
control inputs, :math:`D_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p` is the set of exogenous
disturbances within :math:`S_i`, and :math:`s[t], u[t], d[t]` are the
continuous state, the control signal and the exogenous disturbance,
respectively, at time :math:`t`.

LtiSysDyn class is used to represent subsystems of the form
:eq:`pwadynamics`.

     .. autoclass:: hybrid.LtiSysDyn
	:noindex:

The subsystems can be put together to define a piecewise affine system which
is represented by PwaSysDyn class.

     .. autoclass:: hybrid.PwaSysDyn
	:noindex:


Example 3: Robot Motion Planning with Piecewise Affine Dynamics
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This example is provided in examples/pwa.py.
It is an extension of the previous examples including a robot model
with piecewise affine dynamics.

Assume our robot is traveling on a nonhomogenous surface (x-y plane),
resulting in different dynamics at different parts of the plane.
Since the continuous state space in this example is just x-y position, different
dynamics in different parts of the surface can be modeled as a piecewise
affine system. When :math:`s[t] \in[0, 3]\times[0.5, 2]`, the following dynamics
are active:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pwa.py
   :start-after: @subsystem0@
   :end-before: @subsystem0_end@

When :math:`s[t] \in[0, 3]\times[0, 0.5]`, the following dynamics
are active:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pwa.py
   :start-after: @subsystem1@
   :end-before: @subsystem1_end@

Piecewise affine system can be formed from the dynamics of its subsystems.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pwa.py
   :start-after: @pwasystem@
   :end-before: @pwasystem_end@

Discretization and synthesis follow exactly as before.
