Specifications
==============

Currently only specifications expressed as GR(1) formulae (which constitutes a
sublanguage of LTL) can be used for synthesis in TuLiP.  Nonetheless a more
general LTL specification string is described in the below section
:ref:`tulip-ltl-label`, and it is supported through the class ``tulip.spec.LTL``.

Getting started
---------------

To create an empty LTL formula and print it, try

.. code-block:: python

  from tulip.spec import LTL
  f = LTL()
  print(f)

The GR(1) formula :math:`\square \Diamond p`, in which the environment is empty
(so, there is no "assumption" part of the specification), and where :math:`p` is
Boolean and controlled, can be created and printed as a specification string
(cf. :ref:`tulip-ltl-label`) by

.. code-block:: python

  from tulip.spec import GRSpec
  f = GRSpec(sys_vars={"p"}, sys_prog=["p"])
  print(f.dumps())

The result of which should look similar to

.. code-block:: none

  0  # Version
  
  %%
  OUTPUT:
  p : boolean;
  
  %%
  []<>(p)

If you are only interested in the formula itself, presented minimally or with
pretty-formatting, then also try

.. code-block:: python

  print(f)
  print(f.pretty())

The result of the second line (using ``pretty()``) should look similar to

.. code-block:: none

  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
	  (none)

  SYSTEM VARIABLES:
	  p	boolean

  FORMULA:
  ASSUMPTION:
  GUARANTEE:
      LIVENESS
	    []<>(p)

TuLiP LTL syntax
----------------
The LTL syntax defined in `EBNF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form>`_ below can be parsed by ``tulip.spec.plyparser``::

  expr ::= expr '*' expr
         | expr '/' expr
         | expr '+' expr
         | expr '-' expr
         
         | expr '=' expr | expr '==' expr
         | expr '!=' expr
         | expr '<=' expr
         | expr '>=' expr
         
         | '!' expr
         | expr '&' expr | expr '&&' expr
         | expr '|' expr | expr '||' expr
         | expr '^' expr # xor
         
         | expr '->' expr
         | expr '<->' expr
         
         | 'X' expr | 'next' expr
         | '[]' expr | 'G' expr
         | '<>' expr | 'F' expr
         
         | expr 'U' expr
         | expr 'R' expr
         
         | '(' expr ')'
         
         | TRUE | FALSE
         | NUMBER
         | variable
         | string

  variable ::= NAME
  
  string ::= '"' NAME '"'

where:

- NAME can be any alphanumeric other than ``next`` that does not start with any character from ``'F', 'G', 'R', 'U', 'X'``.
- NUMBER any non-negative integer
- TRUE is case-insensitive 'true'
- FALSE is case-insensitive 'false'

The token precedence (lowest to highest) and associativity (r = right, l = left, n = none) is:

- **U**, **R** (r)
- **<->** (r)
- **->** (r)
- **^** (l)
- **|** (l)
- **&** (l)
- **[]**, **<>** (r)
- **X** (r)
- **!** (r)
- **=**, **<=**, **>=**, **>** (n)
- **\***, **/** (n)
- **+**, **-** (n)
- TRUE, FALSE

Expressions of the above form are successfully parsed.
This does *not* mean that they can be used to produce valid output to be fed to specific solvers.
In other words the parser is more permissive than what each tool (and others to be added in the future) supports.

For example: ``variable '+' variable`` is valid as parser input, but **may be invalid** when passed to a particular solver.

Full operator names
```````````````````
If you would like to use as operators strings like: ``and``, then your input can be converted automatically to the above syntax by the following lexical substitutions:

- ``next`` -> ``X``
- ``always`` -> ``[]``
- ``eventually`` -> ``<>``
- ``until`` -> ``U``
- ``stronguntil`` -> ``U``
- ``weakuntil`` -> ``W``
- ``unless`` -> ``W``
- ``release`` -> ``V``
- ``implies`` -> ``->``
- ``equivalent`` -> ``<->``
- ``not`` -> ``!``
- ``and`` -> ``&&``
- ``or`` -> ``||``

These substitutions are **not** enabled by default.
In order to enable them, pass the argument ``full_operators = True`` to ``tulip.spec.parser.parser``.

TuLiP LTL specification files
-----------------------------

*The description of format here is normative.* While details may
vary among versions of the format, it is always the case that the first
non-blank line must be the version number, which is a non-negative integer.

Version 0
`````````

.. highlight:: none

An LTL specification file must consist of three sections, which are separated by
``%%``.  The first section is referred to as the **preamble**, the second as the
**declarations section**, and the third as the **formula section**.  Comments
can appear anywhere, are begun with ``#``, and continue to the end of the line.
Entirely blank lines are ignored.  In the preamble, the first non-blank line
must be the version number, which is a non-negative integer.

In the declarations section, there are two optional keywords that may appear in
any order: ``INPUT:`` and ``OUTPUT:``.  If given, each must appear on its own
line, with no variable declarations.  All variable declarations following
``INPUT:``, up to the appearance of ``OUTPUT:`` or ``%%``, are taken to be
"input variables", sometimes called uncontrolled or part of the "environment".
All variable declarations following ``OUTPUT:``, up to the appearance of
``INPUT:`` or ``%%``, are taken to be "output variables", sometimes called
controlled or part of the "system".  The default behavior (i.e., if these
keywords are omitted) is that of ``OUTPUT:``.

A variable declaration is of the form ``name : domain;``.  It may span multiple
lines.  The domain may be

- ``boolean``, if the variable (i.e., atomic proposition) can either be True or
  False;
- ``[a,b]``, where ``a`` and ``b`` are integers; or
- ``{...}``, where ``...`` is a comma-separated list.  The parser will attempt
  to cast each element as an integer; if it fails, then the element is saved
  verbatim as a string.

Everything appearing after the second ``%%``, excepting comments, is considered
to be part of the LTL formula.  Much of the syntax is taken from the `LTL
formula syntax <http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/ltl.html>`_ of `Spin
<http://spinroot.com/spin/>`_.  While it will later be expressed by a (Extended?)
BNF grammar, the formula syntax is descibed in the following.

1. An **identifier** is of the form ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_.]*`` Note that we do
   not restrict identifiers from beginning with operator keywords, e.g., **X**
   because of the spacing requirement (see below).
2. **True** and **False** are Boolean constants.  No variable (identifier) can
   be thus named.
3. Boolean operators are **!** (negation), **&&** (conjunction), **||**
   (disjunction), **->** (implication), and **<->** (equivalence).
4. Temporal operators are **[]** (always), **<>** (eventually), **X** (next),
   **U** (until), **V** or **R** (release).
5. Notice that the alternative operators **/\\** and **\\/** for **&&** and
   **||**, respectively, are not included; cf. the `Spin LTL formula syntax
   <http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/ltl.html>`_.  Furthermore, **W** (weak until)
   is not included, except for the parser of the GR(1) fragment.
6. Space is required wherever its absence would cause parsing ambiguity.  E.g.,
   ``Xp`` is always an identifier, whereas ``X p`` is a formula in which the next
   operator is applied to the identifier ``p``.
7. Let ``u`` and ``v`` be variables over integer domains, and let ``k`` be an integer.
   Then "basic comparisons" are ``u < v``, ``u = v``, ``u < k``, and ``u = k``. The
   following derived operators are also available, with their meaning matching
   that of the C language: ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``!=``.  Addition within comparisons,
   given in the form ``u < v+k`` or ``u = v+k``, is available, along with derived
   comparisons as in the previous item.  Subtraction is similarly supported;
   replace ``+`` with ``-``.
